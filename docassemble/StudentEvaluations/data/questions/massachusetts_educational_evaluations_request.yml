question: | 
  Getting started
subquestion: |
  This letter will help you ask your child’s school to {evaluate} your child. Before you start, you will need:
  
  1. The name and address of the special education coordinator or director for your child’s school district.
  2. Your child’s full name and date of birth.
  3. If your child ALREADY HAS an {IEP}, you will need the name and email of the special education coordinator or director for your child’s school. The name of your child’s special education coordinator should be listed on your child’s IEP.
  4. If your child does NOT have an IEP, you will need the name and email for your child’s school principal or teacher. Your child will not have a special education coordinator assigned so you can send the letter to your child’s school principal or teacher.

  If you need help, please contact MAC’s helpline at 617-357-8431 or send a message [here](https://www.massadvocates.org/helpline).
