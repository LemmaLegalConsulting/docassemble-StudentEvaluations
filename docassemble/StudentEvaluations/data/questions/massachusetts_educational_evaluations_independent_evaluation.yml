  Requesting an Independent Evaluation
subquestion: |
  This website will help you request independent evaluations for 
  your child.
  
  When you see your letter at the end, you can add or remove evaluations from 
  the letter.  
  
  It is a good idea to talk to your child's pediatrician or 
  specialists about other evaluations they might need if you 
  are unsure.
  
  Before you get started:
  
  * This letter is for children who are already enrolled in school.
  * You need to know **who** you want to evaluate your child. If you are not
    sure, you may want to talk to an advocate or your child's doctor to get
    a recommendation first.
