question: |
  Requesting an Independent Evaluation
subquestion: |
 This website will help you request that your child’s school pay for an independent evaluation for your child. An independent evaluation is like a second opinion to an evaluation the school already did.  You can ask for an independent evaluation if you disagree with a school evaluation.

 When you see your letter at the end, you can make changes.
 
 It is a good idea to talk to your child’s pediatrician or specialists about other evaluations they might need if you are unsure.

  
  Before you get started:
  
  * This letter is for children who are already enrolled in school.
  * You need to know **who** you want to evaluate your child. If you are not sure, you may want to talk to an advocate or your child’s doctor to get a recommendation first.
