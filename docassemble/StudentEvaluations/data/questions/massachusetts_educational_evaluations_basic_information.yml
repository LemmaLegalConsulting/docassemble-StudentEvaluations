  What else do I need to know?
content: |
    - If a parent or caregiver requests a special education evaluation for their child, the school must do an educational assessment. If the child is 14 or older, the school must do a transition assessment.
     
    - The school must also do assessments in **all** areas related to a child’s possible disability. For example, if it is hard for your child to communicate, the school might do a speech and language evaluation. They may do an evaluation that looks at other ways for your child to communicate (like an augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) evaluation. Or, if your child has trouble with stairs, the school may do a physical therapy evaluation. It is different for every student.
     
    - You can request additional evaluations even if the school has not suggested them.
     
    - You may not know of any evaluations to request for your child. This is okay. Before or after you complete this letter you can talk to your child’s doctor or other service providers outside of school.
    
    - Someone from your child’s school should also contact you when they receive this letter to talk to you about your concerns. When you talk to the school, you can give them more information. This will help the school decide which evaluations your child needs.
    
    - If you do not hear from the school in writing in 5 school days, try contacting them until you speak with someone or receive the consent form.

  What evaluations can I ask for?
content: |
  What evaluations can I ask for? ? Hyperlink [This is a list of common evaluations. There are types of evaluations that may not be listed here. It is a good idea to speak with your child’s doctor or other service providers with any questions.]

  
  An educational assessment looks at your child's learning skills. It includes a history of your child’s progress. This progress is compared to the state’s learning standards. A teacher who knows your child well should give this history. The assessment should also look at how your child:
  - Pays attention
  - Communicates
  - Remembers things
  - Participates in school
  - Interacts with other students and adults
  
  A psychological evaluation gives information about your child's problem-solving, memory, attention, and processing skills. It may look at anxiety, depression, and behavior. This information can be used to identify any disabilities and understand how your child learns best. 
  
  A speech and language evaluation looks at how your child understands and uses spoken and written language. This includes your child's:
  - Use of grammar (skill of putting words together to make sentences)
  - Use and knowledge of words
  - Physical ability to pronounce words
  - Stuttering (difficulty saying words smoothly)
  - How your child share information or felings with others (can include eye contact, taking turns, voice volume)
  
  An occupational therapy evaluation looks at your child’s skills when doing certain activities. These skills may include:
  - The hand muscle skills your child needs to hold a pencil, write or type, use scissors, or use a zipper (this is called fine motor skills).
  - The skills your child needs to understand what they see (this is called visual perceptual skills).
  - The skills your child uses to connect their body’s movements with what they see (this is called visual motor skills).
  - How your child responds to information they get from sight, sound, touch, and taste (this is called sensory processing skills).
  - The skills your child uses to decide how to get things done, such as planning, managing time, and organizing (this is called executive functioning skills).
  - The skills your child uses to get dressed, eat, and go to the bathroom (this is called daily living skills).
  Part of the evaluation could include observing your child in the classroom, lunchroom, or at recess. This helps to understand how your child does in the school setting.
  
  A functional behavior assessment (FBA) tries to find out why your child behaves in specific ways if there are behaviors that might keep your child from learning. Examples are leaving the classroom or pushing other students when in line. An FBA can include a plan to change behaviors.
  
  A physical therapy assessment looks at whether your child’s disability affects how your child, for example:
  - Sits or stands
  - Stays steady 
  - Is strong
  - Moves their body
  - Can keep going
  - Uses their arms, legs, and middle part of the body
  - Moves around in schoool and other places
  
  An augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) evaluation looks at the tool(s) that can help your child communicate. Examples include
  - Picture boards
  - Sign language
  - Speech-generating devices
  AAC is a type of assistive technology. It is often useful for students who are non-speaking or have limited speech.
  
  An assistive technology evaluation looks at ways to keep your child's practical skills or make them better. Examples include:
  - iPad App to improve a non-speaking student's communication skills (see also AAC evaluation above)
  - Keyboard for writing
  - Graphic organizer
  - Electronic readers
  
  A home assessment looks at the student's family history and home life. If a parent says it is ok, this may include a home visit.
  
  A health assessment looks at medical issues that affect a student's learning.
  
  Transistion assessment is a process that starts before your child turns 14. It can help determine your child's strengths, preferences, interests, and needs. This information can help your child decide their adult life goals. These life goals are related to education, finding and keeping a job, and independent living. A transition assessment also identifies IEP transition services that will support your child to make progress towards their goals.
